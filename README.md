<h1>SQL Exploratory Data Analysis of Global Layoffs (2020–2023)</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
For this project, I performed a full Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the cleaned global layoffs dataset, using SQL to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies across companies, industries, countries, and time periods. I began with foundational summary statistics: identifying maximum layoffs, companies with 100% workforce reductions, and the highest-funded firms, and then analyzed layoffs aggregated by company, industry, country, and year. I evaluated temporal patterns by calculating totals per year and month, and built a rolling monthly layoff total using window functions to visualize how workforce reductions accumulated over time. I also explored company-specific layoff behavior by creating multi-step CTE pipelines to rank firms by total layoffs within each year, identifying the top contributors and highlighting shifts across 2020–2023. This project demonstrated my ability to use SQL for complex analysis, including grouping, ordering, window functions, date parsing, substring logic, and multi-layered CTE queries to derive meaningful insights from real-world workforce data.
